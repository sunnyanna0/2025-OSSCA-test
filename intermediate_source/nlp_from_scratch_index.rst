NLP from Scratch
================

In these three-part series you will build and train
a basic character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify words.
이 세 부분으로 구성된 시리즈에서는 단어를 분류하기 위한 문자 단위 순환 신경망(RNN)을 직접 만들고 학습합니다. 

You will learn:
다음 내용을 다룹니다.

* How to construct Recurrent Neural Networks from scratch
* Essential data handling techniques for NLP
* How to train an RNN to identify the language origin of words.
* 순환 신경망을 처음부터 구현하는 방법
* 자연어 처리를 위한 필수 데이터 처리 기법
* 단어의 언어 기원을 식별하도록 RNN을 학습하는 방법
